# MLP From Scratch with Numpy
Perform MLP computation flow on top of Numpy library. Set of neurons is represented by `Dense` layer class. Forward and backward pass is handled by `MultiLayerPerceptron` class. Inspired by Keras API.

## Setup
1. Python3
2. Install dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Run

`python3 main.py`
